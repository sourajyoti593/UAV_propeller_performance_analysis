UAV Propeller Performance Analysis
Project Overview
The increasing use of small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in civil and military applications has brought attention to the need for optimizing propulsion systems. This project aims to address aerodynamic challenges associated with small UAVs by developing a data-driven framework to predict propeller performance, crucial for urban air mobility. The project leverages both standalone and ensemble machine learning techniques to forecast thrust coefficient, power coefficient, and efficiency based on blade geometry and operational inputs.

Objectives
Data Preparation: Combine and preprocess datasets containing propeller and blade geometry data.
Feature Engineering: Calculate essential features like radius and chord distributions, blade area, disc area, and propeller solidity.
Modeling: Develop machine learning models to predict the performance metrics of propellers.
Analysis & Visualization: Perform bivariate analysis and create visualizations, including heatmaps, to identify correlations and insights.
Datasets
The project uses multiple datasets containing experimental data and geometric characteristics of UAV propellers:

Experiment_vol1.xlsx, Experiment_vol2.xlsx, Experiment_vol3.xlsx: These files contain data on propeller performance metrics.
Geom_vol1.xlsx, Geom_vol2.xlsx, Geom_vol3.xlsx: These files include geometric properties of propellers and blades.
Each dataset contains the following key variables:

Propeller Name, Blade Name, Propeller Brand
Number of Blades, Propeller Diameter, Propeller Pitch
Advanced Ratio, RPM, Thrust Coefficient, Power Coefficient, Efficiency
